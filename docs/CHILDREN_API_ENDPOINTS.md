## üîê Security & Access Control

### Role-Based Access
- **Parents**: Can only view their own children
- **Coaches**: Cannot access children endpoints (use players endpoints instead)
- **Players**: Cannot access children endpoints
- **Admins**: Should have access to all children (future enhancement)

### Data Privacy
- Parents can only see their own children's information
- Children's personal data is protected from unauthorized access
- API responses should not include sensitive information like passwords or internal IDs

### Authentication Requirements
- All endpoints require valid Bearer token
- Token must belong to a user with parent role
- Token validation should check user role before allowing access

## üìù Implementation Notes

### Backend Requirements
1. **User Role Validation**: Check if authenticated user has 'parent' role
2. **Parent-Child Relationship**: Verify the parent-child relationship exists
3. **Data Filtering**: Ensure parents only see their own children
4. **Pagination**: Implement proper pagination for large datasets
5. **Search Functionality**: Implement search by name, email, or other relevant fields

### Database Considerations
1. **Parent-Child Relationship Table**: Store parent-child associations
2. **Indexing**: Index on parent_id and child_id for efficient queries
3. **Data Consistency**: Ensure referential integrity between users and relationships

### Error Handling
1. **Clear Error Messages**: Provide meaningful error messages for different scenarios
2. **Proper HTTP Status Codes**: Use appropriate status codes for different error types
3. **Logging**: Log access attempts and errors for security monitoring

## üöÄ Future Enhancements

### Potential Additional Endpoints

2. **Child Schedule**: View child's class schedule and upcoming events
3. **Child Performance**: View child's match results and statistics
4. **Parent Notifications**: Get notifications about child's activities

### Advanced Features
1. **Multiple Parents**: Support for children with multiple parents/guardians
2. **Parent Permissions**: Different permission levels for different parents
3. **Child Invitations**: Allow parents to invite children to the platform
4. **Parent Dashboard**: Comprehensive view of all children's activities
