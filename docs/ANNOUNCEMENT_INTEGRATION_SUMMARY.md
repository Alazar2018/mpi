# Announcement Service Integration Summary

## Overview
Successfully integrated the announcement service with the connect and announcement pages using the same axios interceptor pattern as `learn.server.ts`. All sample data has been removed and replaced with proper API integration.

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. Created `announcement.server.ts`
- **Location**: `src/service/announcement.server.ts`
- **Pattern**: Follows the same structure as `learn.server.ts` with axios interceptors
- **Features**:
  - Role-based access control (Coach, Player, Parent)
  - All 9 API endpoints implemented as per requirements
  - Proper TypeScript interfaces for all data structures
  - Error handling and validation

### 2. Updated `announcements.tsx`
- **Location**: `src/features/connect/announcements.tsx`
- **Changes Made**:
  - Removed all sample/hardcoded data
  - Integrated with `announcementService`
  - Added proper loading states and error handling
  - Implemented role-based UI (only coaches can create announcements)
  - Added real-time data fetching from API
  - Implemented proper CRUD operations

### 3. API Endpoints Implemented
All endpoints from the requirements have been implemented:

1. **POST /announcements** - Create announcement (Coach only)
2. **GET /announcements** - Get all announcements with role-based filtering
3. **PATCH /announcements/:id/read** - Mark as read
4. **GET /announcements/my** - Get my announcements (Coach only)
5. **GET /announcements/my/:id** - Get single my announcement (Coach only)
6. **PATCH /announcements/my/:id** - Update my announcement (Coach only)
7. **DELETE /announcements/my/:id** - Delete my announcement (Coach only)
8. **DELETE /announcements/:id** - Soft delete announcement
9. **DELETE /announcements** - Clear all announcements

### 4. Role-Based Access Control
- **Coach Role**:
  - Can create, edit, delete, and view all announcements
  - Can manage their own announcements
  - Can soft-delete any announcement they can view

- **Player Role**:
  - Cannot create announcements
  - Can view announcements targeted to "All" and "Players"
  - Can mark announcements as read
  - Can soft-delete announcements they can view

- **Parent Role**:
  - Same permissions as Player role
  - Cannot create announcements
  - Can view and interact with appropriate announcements

### 5. Features Implemented
- **Real-time Data**: Fetches announcements from API on component mount
- **Search Functionality**: Search through announcements by title, description, or category
- **Create Modal**: Form for coaches to create new announcements
- **Detail Modal**: View full announcement details
- **Delete Functionality**: Soft delete announcements (hide from view)
- **Loading States**: Proper loading indicators during API calls
- **Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages
- **Responsive Design**: Maintains existing UI/UX patterns

### 6. Technical Implementation
- **Axios Interceptors**: Uses the same authentication and token refresh logic as other services
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety with proper interfaces
- **State Management**: React hooks for local state management
- **API Integration**: Proper error handling and response processing
- **Role Validation**: Server-side and client-side role checking

## Files Modified/Created

### New Files
- `src/service/announcement.server.ts` - Complete announcement service

### Modified Files
- `src/features/connect/announcements.tsx` - Updated to use new service

### Unchanged Files
- `src/features/connect/connect.tsx` - Navigation remains the same
- All other connect features remain unchanged

## Integration Points

### Authentication
- Uses the same `axiosInstance` with automatic token handling
- Integrates with existing `useAuthStore` for user role information
- Follows the same pattern as `learn.server.ts`

### Navigation
- Announcements page remains accessible via `/admin/connect/announcements`
- No changes to routing or navigation structure

### UI/UX
- Maintains existing design patterns and styling
- Adds proper loading states and error handling
- Responsive design preserved

## Testing Considerations

### API Endpoints
- All endpoints are properly configured with correct HTTP methods
- Query parameters and path parameters are correctly implemented
- Response handling follows the specified API contract

### Role-Based Access
- Coach users can access all functionality
- Player/Parent users are restricted appropriately
- UI elements are conditionally rendered based on user role

### Error Scenarios
- Network errors are handled gracefully
- API errors display user-friendly messages
- Loading states prevent multiple simultaneous requests

## Next Steps

### Potential Enhancements
1. **Pagination**: Implement pagination for large announcement lists
2. **Real-time Updates**: Add WebSocket integration for live updates
3. **Rich Text**: Support for rich text formatting in announcements
4. **Attachments**: Support for file attachments
5. **Notifications**: Push notifications for new announcements

### Monitoring
- Monitor API response times and error rates
- Track user engagement with announcements
- Monitor role-based access patterns

## Conclusion

The announcement service has been successfully integrated with full role-based access control, removing all sample data and implementing proper API integration. The service follows the established patterns in the codebase and provides a robust foundation for announcement management.

All requirements from the API specification have been implemented, and the UI maintains the existing design while adding proper functionality and error handling.
