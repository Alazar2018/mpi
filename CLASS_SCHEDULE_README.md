# Class Schedule Feature Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of the Class Schedule feature for the MPI SPA application. The feature allows players, parents, and coaches to manage tennis class scheduling requests.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Server Layer (`src/service/classSchedule.server.ts`)
- **API Integration**: Complete integration with the Class Schedule Request API
- **Type Definitions**: Full TypeScript interfaces for all API responses and requests
- **Axios Interceptors**: Uses the existing axios configuration with JWT authentication
- **Role-based Endpoints**: Separate functions for player, parent, and coach operations

#### Key Functions:
- **Player Functions**: `getMyClassScheduleRequests`, `getMyCoaches`, `createClassScheduleRequest`
- **Parent Functions**: `getMyChildren`, `getChildCoaches`, `createClassScheduleRequestForChild`
- **Coach Functions**: `getCoachClassScheduleRequests`, `respondToClassScheduleRequest`

### 2. Custom Hook (`src/hooks/useClassSchedule.ts`)
- **State Management**: Centralized state for requests, coaches, children, and availability
- **Role-based Logic**: Automatically fetches appropriate data based on user role
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages
- **Loading States**: Loading indicators for better UX

### 3. Main Component (`src/features/class-schedule/classSchedule.tsx`)
- **Responsive Design**: Modern, clean UI with Tailwind CSS
- **Role-based UI**: Different interfaces for players, parents, and coaches
- **Tab Navigation**: Separate tabs for viewing requests and scheduling new classes
- **Modal Forms**: Clean modal interfaces for creating requests and responding to them

#### UI Features:
- **Status Badges**: Color-coded status indicators (pending, accepted, rejected)
- **Action Buttons**: Edit, delete, and respond buttons based on user role and request status
- **Form Validation**: Client-side validation for required fields
- **Date/Time Picker**: Native datetime-local input for scheduling

### 4. Navigation Integration
- **Menu Item**: Added "Class Schedule" to navigation for all relevant roles
- **Route Configuration**: New route `/admin/class-schedule` with proper protection
- **Role-based Access**: Navigation item visible to players, parents, and coaches

## User Experience by Role

### Player Experience
- View all class schedule requests
- Schedule new classes with coaches
- Edit pending requests
- Delete pending requests
- View coach responses and notes

### Parent Experience
- View all class schedule requests for children
- Select child and coach for scheduling
- Schedule classes on behalf of children
- Manage existing requests

### Coach Experience
- View all incoming class schedule requests
- Accept or reject requests with notes
- Update responses to requests
- View player information and notes

## Technical Implementation Details

### State Management
- Uses React hooks for local state
- Custom hook for API calls and data management
- Automatic data fetching based on user role

### Form Handling
- Native HTML form elements for simplicity
- Controlled components with React state
- Client-side validation
- Proper error handling and user feedback

### API Integration
- RESTful API calls with proper error handling
- JWT authentication via axios interceptors
- Type-safe API responses with TypeScript
- Pagination support for large datasets

### Responsive Design
- Mobile-first approach with Tailwind CSS
- Responsive grid layouts
- Touch-friendly buttons and forms
- Consistent spacing and typography

```

## Usage Examples

### Scheduling a Class (Player/Parent)
1. Navigate to Class Schedule page
2. Click "Schedule New Class" tab
3. Select coach from dropdown
4. Choose date and time
5. Add optional notes
6. Submit request

### Responding to Request (Coach)
1. Navigate to Class Schedule page
2. View pending requests in "Student Requests" tab
3. Click "Respond" button on a request
4. Choose accept/reject status
5. Add optional notes
6. Submit response

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket integration for live status updates
- **Calendar Integration**: Sync with existing calendar functionality
- **Email Notifications**: Automated email notifications for status changes
- **Availability Calendar**: Visual calendar showing coach availability
- **Recurring Classes**: Support for recurring class schedules
- **Payment Integration**: Link to payment system for paid classes

### Technical Improvements
- **Form Library**: Integration with React Hook Form for better form handling
- **State Management**: Consider Redux or Zustand for complex state
- **Caching**: Implement request caching for better performance
- **Offline Support**: Service worker for offline functionality

## Testing Considerations

### Unit Tests
- Test custom hook functions
- Test component rendering for different roles
- Test form validation and submission
- Test error handling scenarios

### Integration Tests
- Test API integration
- Test role-based access control
- Test form submission flows
- Test modal interactions

### User Acceptance Tests
- Test complete user workflows
- Test responsive design on different devices
- Test accessibility features
- Test performance with large datasets

## Security Considerations

### Authentication
- JWT token validation on all API calls
- Role-based access control
- Session management

### Data Validation
- Client-side validation for UX
- Server-side validation for security
- Input sanitization
- XSS prevention

### Authorization
- Users can only access their own data
- Parents can only manage their children's data
- Coaches can only respond to their own requests

## Conclusion

The Class Schedule feature provides a comprehensive solution for managing tennis class scheduling within the MPI SPA application. It follows the existing code patterns and architecture while providing a modern, user-friendly interface for all user roles.

The implementation is production-ready with proper error handling, loading states, and responsive design. The code is well-structured, type-safe, and follows React best practices.
